Adds colors to raw diffs on codereview.chromium.org to make them easier to read.

I made this extension because sometimes it's easier to see an entire CL at once, instead of looking at the changes one file at a time. You can do that by clicking "Download raw patch set" of course, but that tends to be pretty hard to read. This extension improves readability by adding colors to the output, much like `git diff` does.
